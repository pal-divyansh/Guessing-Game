# Guess the Number Game

## Overview
This is a simple web-based "Guess the Number" game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## Files Structure
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the webpage.
- **style.css**: The stylesheet that defines the visual appearance of the game.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input field.
3. Click the "Guess" button.
4. The game will provide feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. If the guess is correct, the game resets after a few seconds.
